# Predicting the Patterns and Causes of Research Paper Retractions (1940â€“2024)
# Context
In 2023, more than 10,000 research papers were retracted, the highest number ever recorded. This means more studies were found to have mistakes or dishonest work. The rise in retractions is worrying because governments often use scientific research to make laws and policies. If that research is wrong, it can lead to bad decisions and loss of public trust. Tracking and studying these retractions helps us understand why they happen and how to improve honesty and quality in science.
